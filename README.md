# Security Alerts - a Chrome Extension

This Chrome Extension is part of my master thesis on _Opportune Moments for Security Tasks_. It's designed to provide
security enhancing suggestions to the user. You will be asked to complete a short survey after every interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Google Chrome Browser
    - please make sure to
      enable [Google SYNC](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB)
    - allowed search engines are Google and DuckDuckGo

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Chrome browser
3. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` or click on the three dots in the top right corner and
   select `More tools` -> `Extensions`
4. Enable `Developer mode` in the top right corner
5. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the cloned repository
6. The extension should now be installed and ready to use
7. You can pin the extension to the browser toolbar by clicking on the puzzle piece in the top right corner and then
   clicking on the pin icon next to the extension

## Usage and Study

For this part of the study, you simply have to use the browser as you normally would. The extension will provide you
with security alerts at some moments. You will be asked to complete a short survey after every interaction. We would
highly appreciate it, if you could keep the extension enabled for at least 3 days. You can see whether the study is
still running by clicking on the extension icon in the browser toolbar. After the study is finished, you can remove the
extension and delete the repository.
